implementation, how to use the Store, Effects, Actions, Reducers.\nAlso, can try another way to structure the project, using the modules and lazy loading (even with the NgRx implementation).\nTechnologies\nProject is created with:\n\nAngular v15.0.0\nNgRx v15.3\nBootstrap v5.2.3\nFirebase v9.0.8\n\nFeatures\n\nAuthentication with Firebase\nDashboard with the data loaded from the Firebase database\nUse of NgRx to manage the state of the application\nUse of Angular modules and lazy loading to avoid loading all the application at once\nUse of Angular lazy loading to avoid load states that are not used\n\nPrerequisites to run the application\n\nNode.js v18.0.0 or higher\nAngular CLI v15.0.0 or higher\n\nSetup\nAfter clone the repository, install the dependencies:\nExample :npm installRun the application\nTo run the application, use the command:\nExample :ng serveThis will available the application in the browser at the address: http://localhost:4200\n\nYou can create a new account or use the following credentials:\n\nEmail: admin@test.com\nPassword: 123456\n\nAfter login you can see the dashboard loaded with the data from the Firebase database.\n\nYou can see the details of the income and expenses in the table and add new items in other pages.\nDeployment\nYou can see the app running on Income Expenses
